# WaveformView macOS

An NSView subclass, in Swift (version 3), that reproduces the waveform effect seen in Siri on iOS 7 and 8. Includes a simple example application.

It's a Swift port of [SISinusWaveView](https://github.com/raffael/SISinusWaveView) that also removed the requirement of `EZAudio`. There is also a [WaveformView for iOS](https://github.com/jyunderwood/WaveformView-iOS) that shares most of the same code.
